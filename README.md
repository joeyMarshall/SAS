# SAS

SAS is a Web Application that strives to allow victims anonymously report sexism and harassment. Users are able to report incidents on the app, and in order to get better statistics, they are asked to identify where the incident took place from a list of possible locations, including work, in public, school, home, and online. The application will also have location services that will help to accurately determine the users location. Once they select a place, users are asked to select categories, including sexual harassment, discrimination, stereotype, and others. After posting, users can also see incidents that have been reported by other users. They are able to filter incidents by category and location. They are also able to sort by “most recent” or “most liked” incidents.
