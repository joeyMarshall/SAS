# SAS

This project focuses on UN Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. The sub-goal I will be targeting is:

 5.2, Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls, including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation.
 
SAS is a Web Application that strives to allow victims to anonymously share their stories regarding sexism and harassment. Users are able to report incidents on the app, and in order to get better statistics, they are asked to identify where the incident took place from a list of possible locations, including work, in public, school, home, and online. The application will also have location services that will help to accurately determine the users location. Once they select a place, users are asked to select categories, including sexual harassment, discrimination, stereotype, and others. After posting, users can also see incidents that have been reported by other users. They are able to filter incidents by category and location.
 
## Reason 
This application will create awareness and allow users to see what type of harassments are going on in their area. Sharing these stories allows people to really understand the way sexism impacts peopleâ€™s everyday lives. This application helps victims feel less alone, and raises awareness about sexism through sentimental education. This application fills a gap that I believe will help achieve UN Goal 5.

## Audience
The audience being addressed are women and girls.
